# tile_map_site
Work in progress personal Django App

This project is based around another I've been working on for some time. I have been drawing up a map of a fictional world one tile at a time. 

The purpose of this site is to showcase this project in several ways. 

- An index of the tiles shown in a gridlike pattern where users can see all of the tiles separately at once but still in a mostly cohesive form, in this form users could click on different tiles to get a more detailed look at each.

- Second would be that more detailed view of each, showing a larger image of the tile as well as a short description for each. There is also the ability to navigate through the tiles individually.

- Third will be a way to view the full stitched-together map in a more enjoyable and interactive way. 

This project is stil a work in progress and has a ways to go, but I've been able to get the core of it pretty well together.
